        <p> Tides of Terragos is a two player strategic card game, where each player must manipulate the attributes of their fleet trying to destroy their enemy and conquer the <i>Tides of Terragos</i>.</p>    
        <p><b>Pre-Game Setup:</b> Each player needs to have a thirty card deck that consists of seventy-five million dollars worth of cards, the price of each ship is labeled near the center of each card. Each player needs to line five six-sided dice in front of them, approximately three inches apart. There needs to be about one foot separating the two player's lines of dice, so that you can play your cards between the dice. It is also recommended to have three chips of some kind to help keep track of turns.</p>
        <p><b>How to Win: </b>Each dice begins the game on the six side of the dice. The five dice in front of you represent your five islands. The number on the dice represent its remaining health. If you can reduce one of the opposing player's islands to zero health, you win the game. It's that simple. Destroy an island and you win, there are no other ways to win the game, however, how you achieve this goal can be tremendously different based on the fleet of ships in your deck.</p>

        <p><b>Starting the Game: </b>To start a game of Tides of Terragos, you need to flip a coin, or roll a dice, or something to decide which player is going to have the first turn of the game. After that, both players need to shuffle their decks. Once both player's have shuffled their deck, each player draws their first hand of the game, which consists of five cards. At the end of every third turn, both players will discard each card in their hand. Then each player will draw a new hand. Every new hand, at any time in the game, consists of five cards. </p>
        <p><b>Important Vocabulary: </b>Your deck, the pile of cards that you draw cards from, is referred to as the Shipyard. Whenever you discard, or Scrap, cards, those cards enter a separate pile, referred to as the Scrapyard. In addition to these yards, there also exists another separate pile called the Graveyard. Any card that enters the Graveyard is basically removed from the game. From this point forward, we will refer to those piles by their given names.</p>

      <div class="container__text">            
        <p><b>Active Phases:</b> Each turn begins with the Primary Phase, during this phase the active player (the player whose turn it is) can perform any number of (Active Speed) actions, then that phase ends with that player choosing and performing a command from the list of commands. Once completed, the other player can begin the Secondary Phase where they can perform their actions; if the active player chose the "Declare Attackers" command, the secondary phase ends with a Declare Blockers Step.</p>
        <p><b>Combat Phase: </b>Declaring attackers, simply means that you place your cards face-down in piles in line with the opposing players islands. One important note is that you can only have two ships attacking a single island at any time. Declaring blockers means that you put your ships in between your islands and their attacking face-down ships; you may block with any number of ships on a single island, unlike attackers. As you enter the Combat Phase, the attacking player will reveal their ships, and then if the attacking ships have a higher sum of strength (first number) than the defending ships have a sum of resistance (second number), then you subtract the difference from the number on the island that those ships were attacking. Then the combat phase ends with the Return Step, where each player returns each ship, that they defended or attacked with, to their hand.</p>

      <div class="container__text2">
        <p><b>Rotations: </b>Up to this point we have talked about individual turns. A rotation consists of three turns. At the beginning of each rotation you draw five cards. Then you play three turns, switching back and forth with the other player. Then you scrap each card in your hand. Followed by beginning a new rotation. Continue this cycle until somebody wins the game.</p>
        <p><b>Attributes: </b>The game overall might seem simple thus far, thatâ€™s because the vast majority of the complexity is found in the attributes of individual cards. Most ships are not just strength/resistance bodies, they typically have additional text in the lower half of the card that influences the game dramatically. Lets start with Bounties.  A bounty can be performed during the Bounty Step, by ships that inflicted combat damage. Next, lets talk Retires. Whenever a ship would be scrapped, if that ship has a retire you may perform that retire. If multiple ships are waiting for their retires to be used, perform those retires one at a time, in any order. Once a ship finishes its retire, place it into the scrapyard as expected of any card that was scrapped. Some ships have a mid-combat effect called Maneuvers. Perform these maneuvers during the Offensive Maneuver Step and the Defensive Maneuver Step. As you may expect, offensive maneuver can only be used if the ship is attacking, and defensive maneuvers when defending. Traits are just part of a ship, they do not have label for the word trait, and they do not have to be activated, they are just always active. Last but not least, Actives. To perform an active, you must show the other player the card performing the active. An active is simply an action that can be performed once per turn. Actives can only be performed during your turn before your Command Step, or on the other player's turn after their Command Step and before you would defend. Specifically actives are used during either the Primary Active Step or the Secondary Active Step. A Re-Active is an active that can only be used on the other players turn, during the Secondary Active Step. This is because they affect attacking ships in some manner.</p>
